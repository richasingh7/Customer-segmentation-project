o	Average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction,
o	Limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio),
o	Payments to minimum payments ratio etc (think of more types of similar analysis)
•	Advanced reporting: Use the derived KPIs to gain insight on the customer profiles.
•	Identification of the relationships/ affinities between services.
•	Clustering: Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioral segments of credit card holders
•	Identify cluster characteristics of the cluster using detailed profiling.
•	Provide the strategic insights and implementation of strategies for given set of cluster characteristics
